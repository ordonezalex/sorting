# Sorting

## About

Implementations and comparisons of exchange sort, insert sort, binary insert sort, selection sort, mergesort, mergesort2, mergesort4, quicksort, quicksort, heapsort, and radix sort.

## Objective

Study the effect of implementation language on the sorting algorithms discussed in class and compare them in terms of their runtime complexities.

## Project Description

Implement the following algorithms and report the average running times in nanoseconds of `1000` runs of each size.
Sort randomly generated arrays of sizes `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, and bigger if you will. 
Your program should include a test that prints out an array of size `10` before and after it is sorted with every sorting algorithm.
